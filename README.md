<!-- * What domain of the financial industry is the company in? -->

## Where Does Gemini Fit Within FinTech?
Gemini is firmly planted in the cryptocurrency domain, and its main objective is to help grow the industry, and push cryptocurrency (specifically Bitcoin) towards mass adoption. The cryptocurrency exchange market is still quite new, and changing rapidly. 

Cryptocurrencey exchanges based in the U.S. have come under heavier scrutiny by the SEC in the last 2 years. In 2018, the New York Attorney General at the time Eric Schneiderman, launched a 'fact-finding mission' to understand how exchanges operate, and to determine what their internal defenses and safeguards were.*

During that same year Gemini proposed the creation of the Virtual Commodity Association, which would be a self regulating body for the cryptocurrencey sector. Currently there are three members of the Virtual Commodity Association: bitFlyer, Bittrex and Gemini.

<!-- * What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years? -->
## Trends Within Crypto

A trend that has been happening across crypto exchanges has been the introduction, support and adoption of stable-coins. Stable coins are designed to minimize volatility within the market, and can be pegged to cryptocurrencies, fiat money, or exchange traded commodities.*

With regards to Gemini, it introduced its own stable coin - the Gemini Dollar(GUSD). Coinbase, a competitor of Gemini has expanded its support of a different stable coin, USD(USDC). Both stable coins were issued on the Ethereum platform.

<!-- * What has been the business impact of this company so far?  -->

## Business Impact
Taking U.S. based crypto exchanges into account, Gemini is not considered to be the leader within its field. Coinbase would be considered the industry front runner (in the U.S.) with some of its strengths being: ease of use for beginners, high liquidity, and volume. 

<!-- * What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
-->

## Metrics and Performance

### Industry Metrics
* Volume: which is the total amount traded on the exchange.
* Liquidity: the ability of a coin or token to be converted into a different coin or currency.
* Number of Markets: total number of markets that the exchange is available in.

<!-- * How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain? -->

### Performance 
* Gemini comes in at 29th place according to Coinmarketcap* which monitors and tracks cryptocurrencies globally. Gemini’s volume is slightly below 6.7 million (the top exchange has a volume of over 392 million). 
* Gemini has liquidity of over 4.1 million vs over 70 million from the top exchange.
* Gemini is in roughly 15 markets, as opposed to 834 for the top competitor.

## Recommendations -->

<!-- * If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)  -->
## Avenues For Growth
Gemini’s security and regulatory compliance is one of it’s biggest strengths. It’s desktop and mobile app are easy to use, and provide the user with detailed information for purchasing and trading digital assets.

One of the main things users desire more from Gemini is access to a larger selection of cryptocurrencies. Gemini’s regulatory requirements might limit which coins it can have on its exchange, especially the more volatile exotic coins. Having a larger selection of cryptocurrencies could increase the number of users on its site. 

Another option which could help Gemini gain users would be to allow users to purchase crypto with credit and debit cards directly, which their competitor Coinbase allows. Currently the main options for depositing money into the exchange is through: bank transfer (US only), wire transfer and cryptocurrency transfer.
